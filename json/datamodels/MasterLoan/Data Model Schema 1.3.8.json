The payments are always the same each month even though there are a different number of actual days in each month. This is considered the standard method to calculate monthly payments. DSCR loans should always use 30/360. Some bridge lenders prefer to charge a daily interest rate and they can do so in one of two ways: Actual/360: Instead of dividing the year into 30-day months, this method takes the yearly payment divided by 360 days and charges the daily amount each day so that the payments in a 30-day month are different than a 31-day month. Doing so will charge the borrower 5 extra days of interest each year. OR Actual/365: In this method, the annual payment is divided by 365 days and similar to 360/Actual, the monthly payments will change based on how many calendar days are in each month. The actual amount paid over the year is the same as 30/360."

Lenders may choose to govern the transaction under their own state laws for a variety of reasons, but primarily will choose this option when their state's usury laws permit the lender to charge a higher interest rate than that of the collateral property state. For example: a Washington based lender may want to use Washington's state law, which has no usury limitations for business purpose loans, versus Rhode Island's, which has a maximum usury percentage of 21%. For best practice, there should be a nexus between the governing law state and the underlying parties involved in the transaction. For example, if the lender is located in Florida, it could be appropriate to use Florida as the governing law state. However, it would generally be inappropriate to use Florida as the governing law state if the borrower, lender, and property were all based in another state.",

Some bridge lenders prefer to charge a daily interest rate and they can do so in one of two ways: 360/Actual: Instead of dividing the year into 30-day months, this method takes the yearly payment divided by 360 days and charges the daily amount each day so that the payments in a 30-day month are different than a 31-day month. Doing so will charge the borrower 5 extra days of interest each year. OR 365/Actual: In this method, the annual payment is divided by 365 days and similar to 360/Actual, the monthly payments will change based on how many calendar days are in each month.

If you select 'revolving' this will enable the borrower to repay advances that are made and then re-borrow them later. Depending on which state the property securing the loan is in, you will be able to choose among the following three variants:  Standard, Mandatory, and Optional.  'Optional' provides the most flexibility to the lender in determining when or if to make an advance to the borrower.  All advances are made at lender's discretion. 'Standard' provides a hybrid approach, giving the lender flexibility in using discretion in approving certain conditions the borrower must meet in order to receive an advance.  Once the conditions are approved, however, the advance must be made in most circumstances.  'Mandatory' provides that as long as the conditions for advances are met, with little to no discretion from the lender, the advance must be made in most circumstances. Some states make a distinction between advances made at lender's discretion and those without -- affecting the priority of the lien as to each advance.  In these states, the Mandatory variant is recommended.  The states which make this distinction are: Idaho, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia."
